# Object detection and tracking for traffic flow analysis
Real-time object detection and tracking in dynamic traffic environments present formidable challenges to surveillance systems. The inherent complexities include delays in processing and analyzing video data, inaccuracies in detecting objects like vehicles and pedestrians, unreliable tracking mechanisms, and the crucial need for a more comprehensive understanding of traffic patterns. These challenges collectively hinder the efficiency of traffic management systems, compromising both the accuracy of surveillance data and the overall safety of road users.
The primary goal of this project is to design and implement an advanced real-time object detection and tracking system tailored for dynamic traffic environments.
